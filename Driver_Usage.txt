Usage:

1. Build the SONiX UVC like driver -

   1-1. Check the kernel version is equal to "2.6.32-28-generic" ? if not equal, modify the Makefile (step in 1-1-1.)

       # uname -r

          1-1-1. If kernel version is not matched, change "KERNEL_VERSION" in Makefile 
		 
                 KERNEL_VERSION    := linux-headers-2.6.3X-X-XXXX

   1-2. Change to source code directory to build the SONiX UVC like driver (uvcvideo.ko)

       # make

   1-3. Check the dependencies of driver module (need root privilege)

       # sudo depmode -ae uvcvideo		 

2. Load SONiX UVC like driver -
   
   2-1. Change directory to uvcvideo.ko folder

   2-2. Unload inbox uvc driver first (need root privilege)
 
       # sudo rmmod uvcvideo

   2-3. Load SONiX uvc like driver (need root privilege)

       # sudo insmod uvcvideo.ko

   2-4  Check if the driver is loaded successfully ? (if success, "SONiX UVC Like Driver Initial" is appeared !)

       # dmesg | grep SONiX

3. Live Preview H.264 video by Mplayer -

   3-0 Install Mplayer (need root privilege) 
       or build it by yourself(source code: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html )
   
       # sudo apt-get install mplayer

   3-1 Check the video device number (H.264 device default setting is last one, i.e. maximum device number)

       # ls /dev/video*

   3-2 Start live preview (supposed maximum device number is /dev/video1; if not, replaced by deivce=/dev/video? )

       # mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l2:width=1280:height=720:device=/dev/video1:outfmt=0x34363248 -fps 24

4. Unload SONiX UVC like driver - 

   4-1 Unload SONiX uvc like driver (need root privilege)
